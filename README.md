# Trigonometric Functions Lab

## Overview
This multipage Streamlit application, **Trigonometric Functions of Any Angle Exploration**, is designed to help users understand and visualize trigonometric functions across full angle ranges. The app provides interactive components, graphical visualizations, and real-time computation of trigonometric values.

## Features
- **Unit Circle Visualization:** Plot a unit circle with the indicated angle and corresponding (x, y) coordinates.
- **Trigonometric Functions:** Compute and display sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent values.
- **Interactive Charts:** Explore dynamic line charts showing how each function value varies with the angle.
- **Explanations and Tooltips:** Inline help messages assist in understanding the mathematical concepts and code functionalities.

## Usage
1. Run the app using Streamlit:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Use the sidebar to select the page and adjust the angle input.
3. Choose between degrees and radians for angle measurement.
4. Explore the visualizations and learn about the underlying math concepts.
